This repo contains the source Code for the alphabet replacement task and the JUnitTests produced to develop the code using TDD.

Methodology:

1. JunitTests were designed and developed.
2. Code development was initiated with the sole aim of passing the tests and nothing else.
3. Once tests were passed, code was completed.

*No for or while loops were used.
