This repo contains the source Code, written in java, for an alphabet replacement task that was assigned to me, and the JUnitTests produced to develop the code using TestDrivenDevelopment.

Methodology:

1. JunitTests were designed and developed.
2. Code development was initiated with the sole aim of passing the tests and nothing else.
3. Once tests were passed, code was completed.

*No 'for' or 'while' loops were allowed to be used.
